NOTE!!!<br />
To be able to actually run this code yourself, you will need to ask me for my public API key which I have chosen to not reveal publicly, for obvious security reasons.

To run this code:<br />
1. You need to have already downloaded Android Studio. Official instructions are on the Android Developers website.<br />
2. You need to have the "Google Play services" package installed! In addition, you may also need to install the "Android 5.1.1 (API 22)" package.<br />
3. Open this project now in Android Studio and add the files, that hold my public API key, that I have given to you personally.<br />
4. After doing all that, all you need to do is download this file, and run it in Android Studio.<br />
