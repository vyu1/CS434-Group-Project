NOTE!!!
To be able to actually run this code yourself, you will need to ask me for my public API key which I have chosen to not reveal publicly, for obvious security reasons.

To run this code:
1. You need to have already downloaded Android Studio. Official instructions are on the Android Developers website.
2. You need to have the "Google Play services" package installed! In addition, you may also need to install the "Android 5.1.1 (API 22)" package.
3. Open this project now in Android Studio and add the files, that hold my public API key, that I have given to you personally.
3. After doing all that, all you need to do is download this file, and run it in Android Studio.
